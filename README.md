# Intune Lab: Zero-Touch Onboarding for a Remote Developer

This project demonstrates an automated endpoint provisioning and security hardening process using Microsoft Intune. The goal was to simulate the onboarding of a new remote developer, ensuring their device is secure, configured for productivity, and equipped with necessary tools from the very first login‚Äîwith no manual IT intervention required.

### üîë Key Skills Demonstrated

* Azure AD Join & Automatic Intune Enrollment
* Security Policy Enforcement (BitLocker, Defender AV)
* Configuration Profiles (Settings Catalog)
* Automated Data Protection (OneDrive Known Folder Move)
* Win32 Application Packaging & Deployment
* PowerShell Scripting for Device Customization

### ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow & Results

#### 1. Security & Compliance

A compliance policy was created to enforce BitLocker encryption and ensure Microsoft Defender AV is active. This mitigates security risks from device loss or malware.

#### 2. Automated Data Protection

A configuration profile was deployed to silently enable OneDrive Known Folder Move. This protects user data by syncing the Desktop, Documents, and Pictures folders to the cloud.

#### 3. App Deployment & Device Customization

Visual Studio Code was deployed as a required Win32 app. A PowerShell script was used to create a "Developer Portal" shortcut on the desktop, linking to internal resources.

# Phase 1.2: Configure Core Endpoint Security Policies

## üéØ Objective

To harden the Windows 10/11 provisioning process for remote employees using Microsoft Intune by configuring essential security policies including compliance rules, antivirus, BitLocker encryption, and security baselines.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tasks I Completed

### ‚úÖ 1. Created a Windows 10/11 Compliance Policy

I enforced BitLocker, secure boot, password requirements, and threat level compliance.
